# Webhooks

xpanse exposes webhooks for other systems to update the status of tasks.
Currently, this is used for getting updates from deployment systems such as terra-boot and tofu-maker.

## Security

All webhooks are protected with HMAC by default.
The clients of the webhook must know the secret key from xpanse and use this secret key to generate signature.

### Structure of HMAC signature

```
x-signature: algorithm=HmacSHA256;headers=x-nonce-signature x-timestamp-signature;signature=d4fb456bc7621ed1c8099e8a1136997d6ad9b8613fc79a49b39833d4cb36080a
```

The name of the header - **x-signature**
It must contain algorithm name, headers used in the signature and then the actual signature.
Each key and its value must be **equals =** separated, and each key-value pair must be separated with **semicolon ;**

- Algorithm name must be a valid HMAC algorithm name.
- headers here refer to other headers sent with the request that are part of the signature payload.

### Format of signature data

Clients must first prepare the data in plain text and then sign it with the secret key to generate the signature.
The format of the data is

- value of headers in the signature. Each header must be in a newline.
- Full URL to which the webhook request will be sent in a new line.
- Payload a string in a new line (request body).

:::info multi-line string
The text to be signed must be a multi-line string with each line containing only one piece of information.
:::

### How validation works

The client generates the signature based on the data such as headers, webhook URL and payload (request body).
The format of the signature's plain text data and the secret key is agreed between xpanse and
other applications which will send data to xpanse via webhook APIs.

On receiving the request, xpanse again tries to generate signature data from received data and
generate the signature again. If this signature value matches to the signature value sent in the request header,
then the request is accepted. Otherwise, rejected with HTTP 401.
